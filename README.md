# Billing-Info
The program prompts the user to enter the billing amount and the desired payment, then calculates and outputs the credit or the remaining balance if not paid in full and the penalty amount.

If the user pays the full amount they get $10.00 or 1% of the billing amount, whichever is smaller as credit on your next bill; If you pay at least 50% of the billing Amount, the penalty is 5% of the balance; If you pay at least 20% of the billing Amount and less than 50% of the billing Amount, the penalty is 10% of the balance; otherwise the penalty is 20% of the balance.
